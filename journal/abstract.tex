This paper investigates the use of Integral Force Feedback (IFF) for the active damping of rotating mechanical systems.
Guaranteed stability, typical benefit of IFF, is lost as soon as the system is rotating due to gyroscopic effects.
To overcome this issue, two modifications of the classical IFF control scheme are proposed.
The first consists of slightly modifying the control law while the second consists of adding springs in parallel with the force sensors.
Conditions for stability and optimal parameters are derived.
The results reveal that, despite their different implementations, both modified IFF control scheme have almost identical damping authority on suspension modes.
