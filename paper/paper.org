* Dynamics of Rotating Positioning Platforms
<<sec:dynamics>>
** Model of a Rotating Positioning Platform
# Introduce the fact that we need a simple system representing the rotating aspect
In order to study how the rotation of a positioning platforms does affect the use of integral force feedback, a model of an XY positioning stage on top of a rotating stage is developed.
# Simplest system where gyroscopic forces can be studied
The model is schematically represented in Figure ref:fig:system and forms the simplest system where gyroscopic forces can be studied.

# Present the system, parameters, assumptions (small displacements, perfect spindle)
The rotating stage is supposed to be ideal, meaning it induces a perfect rotation $\theta(t) = \Omega t$ where $\Omega$ is the rotational speed in $\si{\radian\per\second}$.

# X-Y Stage
The parallel XY positioning stage consists of two orthogonal actuators represented by three elements in parallel: a spring with a stiffness $k$ in $\si{\newton\per\meter}$, a dashpot with a damping coefficient $c$ in $\si{\newton\per\meter\second}$ and an ideal force source $F_u, F_v$.
A payload with a mass $m$ in $\si{\kilo\gram}$ is mounted on the (rotating) XY stage.

# Explain the frames (inertial frame x,y, rotating frame u,v)
Two reference frames are used: an inertial frame $(\vec{i}_x, \vec{i}_y, \vec{i}_z)$ and a uniform rotating frame $(\vec{i}_u, \vec{i}_v, \vec{i}_w)$ rigidly fixed on top of the rotating stage with $\vec{i}_w$ aligned with the rotation axis.
The position of the payload is represented by $(d_u, d_v, 0)$ expressed in the rotating frame.

** Equations of Motion
To obtain of equation of motion for the system represented in Figure ref:fig:system, the Lagrangian equations are used:
#+NAME: eq:lagrangian_equations
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right) + \frac{\partial D}{\partial \dot{q}_i} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = Q_i
\end{equation}
with $L = T - V$ the Lagrangian, $D$ the dissipation function, and $Q_i$ the generalized force associated with the generalized variable $\begin{bmatrix}q_1 & q_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}d_u & d_v\end{bmatrix}$.

The constant rotation in the $(\vec{i}_x, \vec{i}_y)$ plane is here disregarded as it is imposed by the ideal rotating stage.
#+NAME: eq:energy_functions_lagrange
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    T & = \frac{1}{2} m \left( \left( \dot{d}_u - \Omega d_v \right)^2 + \left( \dot{d}_v + \Omega d_u \right)^2 \right) \\
    V & = \frac{1}{2} k \left( {d_u}^2 + {d_v}^2 \right) \\
    D & = \frac{1}{2} c \left( \dot{d}_u{}^2 + \dot{d}_v{}^2 \right) \\
    Q_1 &= F_u, \quad Q_2 = F_v
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Substituting equations eqref:eq:energy_functions_lagrange into eqref:eq:lagrangian_equations gives two coupled differential equations
#+NAME: eq:eom_coupled
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    m \ddot{d}_u + c \dot{d}_u + ( k - m \Omega^2 ) d_u &= F_u + 2 m \Omega \dot{d}_v \\
    m \ddot{d}_v + c \dot{d}_v + ( k \underbrace{-\,m \Omega^2}_{\text{Centrif.}} ) d_v &= F_v \underbrace{-\,2 m \Omega \dot{d}_u}_{\text{Coriolis}}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

# Explain Gyroscopic effects
The uniform rotation of the system induces two Gyroscopic effects as shown in Eq. eqref:eq:eom_coupled:
- Centrifugal forces: that can been seen as added negative stiffness $- m \Omega^2$ along $\vec{i}_u$ and $\vec{i}_v$
- Coriolis Forces: that couples the motion in the two orthogonal directions

One can verify that without rotation ($\Omega = 0$) the system becomes equivalent as to two uncoupled one degree of freedom mass-spring-damper systems:
#+NAME: eq:oem_no_rotation
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    m \ddot{d}_u + c \dot{d}_u + k d_u &= F_u \\
    m \ddot{d}_v + c \dot{d}_v + k d_v &= F_v
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

** Transfer Functions in the Laplace domain
To study the dynamics of the system, the differential equations of motions eqref:eq:eom_coupled are transformed in the Laplace domain and the $2 \times 2$ transfer function matrix $\bm{G}_d$ from $\begin{bmatrix}F_u & F_v\end{bmatrix}$ to $\begin{bmatrix}d_u & d_v\end{bmatrix}$ is obtained
\begin{align}
  \begin{bmatrix} d_u \\ d_v \end{bmatrix} &= \bm{G}_d \begin{bmatrix} F_u \\ F_v \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:Gd_mimo_tf} \\
  \bm{G}_{d} &=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{ms^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2}{\left( m s^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2 \right)^2 + \left( 2 m \Omega s \right)^2} & \frac{2 m \Omega s}{\left( m s^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2 \right)^2 + \left( 2 m \Omega s \right)^2} \\
    \frac{-2 m \Omega s}{\left( m s^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2 \right)^2 + \left( 2 m \Omega s \right)^2} & \frac{ms^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2}{\left( m s^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2 \right)^2 + \left( 2 m \Omega s \right)^2}
  \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:Gd_m_k_c}
\end{align}

# Change of variables
To simplify the analysis, the undamped natural frequency $\omega_0$ and the damping ratio $\xi$ are used
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \omega_0 &= \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \text{ in } \si{\radian\per\second} \\
    \xi &= \frac{c}{2 \sqrt{k m}}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The transfer function matrix $\bm{G}_d$ eqref:eq:Gd_m_k_c becomes equal to
#+name: eq:Gd_w0_xi_k
\begin{equation}
\bm{G}_{d} =
  \frac{1}{k}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2}}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} & \frac{2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0}}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} \\
    \frac{- 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0}}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} & \frac{\frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2}}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

# Parameters
For all the numerical analysis in this study, $\omega_0 = \SI{1}{\radian\per\second}$, $k = \SI{1}{\newton\per\meter}$ and $\xi = 0.025 = \SI{2.5}{\percent}$.
# Say that these parameters are not realist but will be used to draw conclusions "relatively"
Even tough no system with such parameters will be encountered in practice, conclusions will be drawn relative to these parameters such that they can be generalized to any other parameter.

** System Dynamics and Campbell Diagram
# Poles computation
The poles of $\bm{G}_d$ are the complex solutions $p$ of
\begin{equation}
  \left( \frac{p^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{p}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{p}{\omega_0} \right)^2 = 0
\end{equation}

Supposing small damping ($\xi \ll 1$), two pairs of complex conjugate poles are obtained:
#+name: eq:pole_values
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    p_{+} &= - \xi \omega_0 \left( 1 + \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \right) \pm j \omega_0 \left( 1 + \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \right) \\
    p_{-} &= - \xi \omega_0 \left( 1 - \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \right) \pm j \omega_0 \left( 1 - \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \right)
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

# Campbell Diagram
The real part and complex part of these two pairs of complex conjugate poles are represented in Figure ref:fig:campbell_diagram as a function of the rotational speed $\Omega$.
As the rotational speed increases, $p_{+}$ goes to higher frequencies and $p_{-}$ to lower frequencies.
The system becomes unstable for $\Omega > \omega_0$ as the real part of $p_{-}$ is positive.
Physically, the negative stiffness term $-m\Omega^2$ induced by centrifugal forces exceeds the spring stiffness $k$.

In the rest of this study, rotational speeds smaller than the undamped natural frequency of the system are assumed ($\Omega < \omega_0$).

# Bode Plots for different ratio W/w0
Looking at the transfer function matrix $\bm{G}_d$ in Eq. eqref:eq:Gd_w0_xi_k, one can see that the two diagonal (direct) terms are equal and the two off-diagonal (coupling) terms are opposite.
The bode plot of these two distinct terms are shown in Figure ref:fig:plant_compare_rotating_speed for several rotational speeds $\Omega$.
# Rapid Analysis of the dynamics
It is confirmed that the two pairs of complex conjugate poles are further separated as $\Omega$ increases.
For $\Omega > \omega_0$, the low frequency complex conjugate poles $p_{-}$ becomes unstable.

* Decentralized Integral Force Feedback
<<sec:iff>>
** Force Sensors and Control Architecture
# Description of the control architecture
In order to apply IFF to the system, force sensors are added in series with the two actuators (Figure ref:fig:system_iff).
As this study focuses on decentralized control, two identical controllers $K_F$ are used to feedback each of the sensed force to its associated actuator and no attempt is made to counteract the interactions in the system.
The control diagram is schematically shown in Figure ref:fig:control_diagram_iff.

** Plant Dynamics
The forces measured by the two force sensors are equal to
#+name: eq:measured_force
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix} f_{u} \\ f_{v} \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} F_u \\ F_v \end{bmatrix} - (c s + k)
  \begin{bmatrix} d_u \\ d_v \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Re-injecting eqref:eq:Gd_w0_xi_k into eqref:eq:measured_force yields
#+name: eq:Gf_mimo_tf
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix} f_{u} \\ f_{v} \end{bmatrix} = \bm{G}_{f} \begin{bmatrix} F_u \\ F_v \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
with $\bm{G}_f$ a $2 \times 2$ transfer function matrix
#+name: eq:Gf
\begin{equation}
  \bm{G}_{f} = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} - \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right) \left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right) + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} & \frac{- \left( 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 \right) \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} \\
  \frac{\left( 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 \right) \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} & \frac{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} - \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right) \left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right) + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The zeros of the diagonal terms of $\bm{G}_f$ are equal to (neglecting the damping for simplicity)
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    z_c &= \pm j \omega_0 \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{8 \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 1} + \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + \frac{1}{2} } \label{eq:iff_zero_cc} \\
    z_r &= \pm   \omega_0 \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{8 \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 1} - \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} - \frac{1}{2} } \label{eq:iff_zero_real}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

It can be easily shown that the frequency of the two complex conjugate zeros $z_c$ eqref:eq:iff_zero_cc lies between the frequency of the two pairs of complex conjugate poles $p_{-}$ and $p_{+}$ eqref:eq:pole_values.

For non-null rotational speeds, two real zeros $z_r$ eqref:eq:iff_zero_real appear in the diagonal terms inducing a non-minimum phase behavior.
This can be seen in the Bode plot of the diagonal terms (Figure ref:fig:plant_iff_compare_rotating_speed) where the magnitude experiences an increase of its slope without any change of phase.

# Show that the low frequency gain is no longer zero
Similarly, the low frequency gain of $\bm{G}_f$ is no longer zero and increases with the rotational speed $\Omega$
#+name: low_freq_gain_iff_plan
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\omega \to 0} \left| \bm{G}_f (j\omega) \right| = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2 - \Omega^2} & 0 \\
  0  & \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2 - \Omega^2}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

# Explain why do we have this low frequency gain
This low frequency gain can be explained as follows: a constant force $F_u$ induces a small displacement of the mass $d_u = \frac{F_u}{k - m\Omega^2}$, which increases the centrifugal force $m\Omega^2d_u = \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2 - \Omega^2} F_u$ which is then measured by the force sensors.

** Decentralized Integral Force Feedback with Pure Integrators
The two IFF controllers $K_F$ consist of a pure integrator
#+NAME: eq:Kf_pure_int
\begin{equation}
  \bm{K}_F(s) = \begin{bmatrix} K_F(s) & 0 \\ 0 & K_F(s) \end{bmatrix}, \quad K_F(s) = g \cdot \frac{1}{s}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is a scalar representing the gain of the controller.

# General explanation for the Root Locus Plot
In order to see how the IFF affects the poles of the closed loop system, a Root Locus (Figure ref:fig:root_locus_pure_iff) is constructed as follows: the poles of the closed-loop system are drawn in the complex plane as the gain $g$ varies from $0$ to $\infty$ for the two controllers simultaneously.
As explained in cite:preumont08_trans_zeros_struc_contr_with,skogestad07_multiv_feedb_contr, the closed-loop poles start at the open-loop poles (shown by $\tikz[baseline=-0.6ex] \node[cross out, draw=black, minimum size=1ex, line width=2pt, inner sep=0pt, outer sep=0pt] at (0, 0){};$) for $g = 0$ and coincide with the transmission zeros (shown by $\tikz[baseline=-0.6ex] \draw[line width=2pt, inner sep=0pt, outer sep=0pt] (0,0) circle[radius=3pt];$) as $g \to \infty$.
The direction of increasing gain is indicated by arrows $\tikz[baseline=-0.6ex] \draw[-{Stealth[round]},line width=2pt] (0,0) -- (0.3,0);$.

[[file:figs/root_locus_pure_iff.pdf]]

# IFF is usually known for its guaranteed stability (add reference) which is not the case anymore due to gyroscopic effects
Whereas collocated IFF is usually associated with unconditional stability cite:preumont91_activ, this property is lost as soon as the rotational speed in non-null due to gyroscopic effects.
This can be seen in the Root Locus (Figure ref:fig:root_locus_pure_iff) where the pole corresponding to the controller is bounded to the right half plane implying closed-loop system instability.

# Physical explanation
Physically, this can be explained by realizing that below some frequency, the loop gain being very large, the decentralized IFF effectively decouples the payload from the XY stage.
Moreover, the payload experiences centrifugal forces, which can be modeled by negative stiffnesses pulling it away from the rotation axis rendering the system unstable, hence the poles in the right half plane.

# Introduce next two sections
In order to apply Decentralized IFF on rotating positioning stages, two solutions are proposed to deal with this instability problem.
The first one consists of slightly modifying the control law (Section ref:sec:iff_hpf) while the second one consists of adding springs in parallel with the force sensors (Section ref:sec:iff_kp).

* Integral Force Feedback with High Pass Filter
<<sec:iff_hpf>>
** Modification of the Control Low
# Reference to Preumont where its done

In order to limit the low frequency controller gain, an high pass filter (HPF) can be added to the controller which becomes
#+NAME: eq:IFF_LHF
\begin{equation}
  \bm{K}_F(s) = \begin{bmatrix} K_F(s) & 0 \\ 0 & K_F(s) \end{bmatrix}, \quad K_{F}(s) = g \cdot \frac{1}{s} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{s/\omega_i}{1 + s/\omega_i}}_{\text{HPF}} = g \cdot \frac{1}{s + \omega_i}
\end{equation}

This is equivalent as to slightly shifting to controller pole to the left along the real axis.
This modification of the IFF controller is typically done to avoid saturation associated with the pure integrator cite:preumont91_activ.
This is however not the case in this study as it will become in the next section.

# Beta controller

** Feedback Analysis
# Explain what do we mean for Loop Gain (loop gain for the decentralized loop)
The loop gains for an individual decentralized controller $K_F(s)$ with and without the added HPF are shown in Figure ref:fig:loop_gain_modified_iff.
The effect of the added HPF is a limitation of the low frequency gain.

# Explain how the root locus changes (the pole corresponding to the controller is moved to the left)
The Root Loci for the decentralized IFF with and without the HPF are displayed in Figure ref:fig:root_locus_modified_iff.
With the added HPF, the poles of the closed loop system are shown to be stable up to some value of the gain $g_\text{max}$
#+NAME: eq:gmax_iff_hpf
\begin{equation}
  g_{\text{max}} = \omega_i \left( \frac{{\omega_0}^2}{\Omega^2} - 1 \right)
\end{equation}
This gain also corresponds as to when the low frequency loop gain reaches one.

# Small rotational speeds allows to increase the control gain
# Large wi allows more gain but less damping

** Optimal Control Parameters

# Controller: two parameters: gain and wi
Two parameters can be tuned for the controller eqref:eq:IFF_LHF: the gain $g$ and the location of the pole $\omega_i$.
The optimal values of $\omega_i$ and $g$ are considered as the values for which the damping of all the closed-loop poles are simultaneously maximized.

# Root Loci
The Root Loci for several $\omega_i$ are shown in Figure ref:fig:root_locus_wi_modified_iff.
It is shown that even tough small $\omega_i$ seems to allow more damping to be added to the system resonances, the control gain $g$ may be limited to small values due to Eq. eqref:eq:gmax_iff_hpf.

* Integral Force Feedback with Parallel Springs

** Stiffness in Parallel with the Force Sensor

As was shown in the previous sections, the instability when using Decentralized IFF for rotating positioning platforms is due to Gyroscopic effects, more precisely to the negative stiffnesses induced by centrifugal forces.
The idea in this section is to include additional springs in parallel with the force sensors to counteract this negative stiffness.
Such springs are schematically shown in Figure ref:fig:system_parallel_springs where $k_a$ is the stiffness of the actuator and $k_p$ the stiffness in parallel with the actuator and force sensor.

Such system could consist of additional springs, or it could also be
This could represent a system where ref:fig:cedrat_xy25xs.
The use of such amplified piezoelectric actuator for IFF is discussed in  cite:souleille18_concep_activ_mount_space_applic.

** Effect of the Parallel Stiffness on the Plant Dynamics
The forces measured by the sensors are equal to

\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix} f_{u} \\ f_{v} \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} F_u \\ F_v \end{bmatrix} - (c s + k_a)
  \begin{bmatrix} d_u \\ d_v \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

A scalar parameter $\alpha$ ($0 \le \alpha < 1$) is defined to describe the fraction of the total stiffness in parallel with the actuator and force sensor
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    k_p &= \alpha k \\
    k_a &= (1 - \alpha) k
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Note that the overall stiffness $k = k_a + k_p$ is kept constant.

\end{equation}

# News terms with \alpha are added
# w0 and xi are the same as before => only the zeros are changing and not the poles.
Comparing $\bm{G}_k$ eqref:eq:Gk with $\bm{G}_f$ eqref:eq:Gf shows that while the poles of the system are kept the same, the zeros of the diagonal terms have changed.

# Negative Stiffness due to rotation => the stiffness should be larger than that
The two real zeros $z_r$ eqref:eq:iff_zero_real that were inducing non-minimum phase behavior are transformed into complex conjugate zeros for
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \alpha &> \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \\
    \Leftrightarrow k_p &> m \Omega^2
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Thus, if the added parallel stiffness $k_p$ is higher than the negative stiffness induced by centrifugal forces $m \Omega^2$, the direct dynamics from actuator to force sensor will show minimum phase behavior.
This is confirmed by the Bode plot in Figure ref:fig:plant_iff_kp.
#  while recovering the alternating poles and zeros near the imaginary axis.


# Root Locus plot
Figure ref:fig:root_locus_iff_kp shows Root Loci plots for $k_p = 0$, $k_p < m \Omega^2$ and $k_p > m \Omega^2$ when $K_F$ is a pure integrator eqref:eq:Kf_pure_int.
It is shown that if the added stiffness is higher than the maximum negative stiffness, the poles of the closed-loop system stay in the (stable) right half-plane, and hence the unconditional stability of IFF is recovered.

** Optimal Parallel Stiffness
# The zero is the poles of the system without the force sensors => w0 = sqrt(kp/m) +/- Omega ?? => seems not true
# Thus, small kp is wanted: kp close to m Omega^2 should give the optimal damping but is not acceptable for robustness reasons
Figure ref:fig:root_locus_iff_kps shows Root Loci plots for several parallel stiffnesses $k_p > m \Omega^2$.
It is shown that large parallel stiffness $k_p$ reduces the attainable damping.
This can be explained by the fact that as the parallel stiffnesses increases, the transmission zeros are closer to the poles.
As explained in cite:preumont18_vibrat_contr_activ_struc_fourt_edition, the attainable damping is generally proportional to the distance between the poles and zeros.
The frequency of the transmission zeros of the system are increasing with the fraction used as parallel stiffness $k_p$.

# Example with kp = 5 m Omega
For any $k_p > m \Omega^2$, the control gain $g$ can be tuned such that the maximum simultaneous damping is added to the resonances of the system as shown in Figure ref:fig:root_locus_opt_gain_iff_kp for $k_p = 5 m \Omega^2$.

* Comparison of the Proposed Modification to Decentralized Integral Force Feedback for Rotating Positioning Stages

# Comparison in terms of modification to the system
The two proposed modification to the decentralized IFF for rotating positioning stages are now compared.
Two modification to the decentralized IFF for rotating positioning stages have been proposed.

The first modification concerns the controller.
It consists of adding an high pass filter to $K_F$ eqref:eq:IFF_LHF.
This allows the system to be stable for gains up to $g_\text{max}$ eqref:eq:gmax_iff_hpf.

The second proposed modification concerns the mechanical system.
If springs are added in parallel to the actuators and force sensors with a stiffness $k_p > m \Omega^2$, decentralized IFF can be applied with unconditional stability.

These two methods are now compared in terms of added damping, closed-loop compliance and transmissibility.
For the following comparisons, the high pass cut-off frequency is set to $\omega_i = 0.1 \omega_0$ and the parallel stiffness is $k_p = 5 m \Omega^2$.

** Comparison of the Attainable Damping
Figure ref:fig:comp_root_locus shows to Root Locus plots for the two proposed IFF techniques.
The maximum added damping is very similar for both techniques and are reached for $g_\text{opt} \approx 2$ in both cases.

#+caption: Root Locus for the two proposed modifications of decentralized IFF, $\Omega = 0.1 \omega_0$

[[file:figs/comp_root_locus.pdf]]

** Comparison Transmissibility and Compliance
The two proposed techniques are now compared in terms of closed-loop compliance and transmissibility.

The compliance is defined as the transfer function from external forces applied to the payload to the displacement of the payload in an inertial frame.
The transmissibility is the dynamics from the displacement of the rotating stage to the displacement of the payload.
It is used to characterize how much vibration of the rotating stage is transmitted to the payload.

The two techniques are also compared with passive damping (Figure ref:fig:system) with $c$ tuned to critically damp the resonance when $\Omega = 0$
\begin{equation}
  c_\text{crit} = 2 \sqrt{k m}
\end{equation}

# IFF with HPF and IFF with kp give very similar results!
Very similar results are obtained for both techniques as shown in Figures ref:fig:comp_compliance and ref:fig:comp_transmissibility.
It is also confirmed that these techniques can significantly damp the system's resonances.

# IFF degrades the compliance at low frequency (add reference)
# Passive Damping degrades the transmissibility at high frequency
Compared to passive damping, the two techniques degrades the compliance at low frequency (Figure ref:fig:comp_compliance).
They however do not degrades the transmissibility as high frequency as its the case with passive damping (Figure ref:fig:comp_transmissibility)
