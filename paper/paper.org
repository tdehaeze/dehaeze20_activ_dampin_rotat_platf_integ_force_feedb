This paper investigates the use of Integral Force Feedback (IFF) for the active damping of rotating mechanical systems.
Guaranteed stability, typical benefit of IFF, is lost as soon as the system is rotating due to gyroscopic effects.
To overcome this issue, two modifications of the classical IFF control are proposed.
The first consists of slightly modifying the control law while the second consists of adding springs in parallel with the force sensors.
Conditions for stability and optimal parameters are derived.
The results reveal that, despite their different implementations, both modified IFF control have almost identical damping authority on suspension modes.

* Introduction
<<sec:introduction>>
There is an increasing need to reduce the undesirable vibration of many sensitive equipment.
A common method to reduce vibration is to mount the sensitive equipment on a suspended platform which attenuates the vibrations above the frequency of the suspension modes.
In order to further decrease the residual vibrations, active damping can be used for reducing the magnification of the response in the vicinity of the resonances.

In cite:preumont92_activ_dampin_by_local_force, the Integral Force Feedback (IFF) control scheme has been proposed, where a force sensor, a force actuator and an integral controller are used to directly augment the damping of a mechanical system.
When the force sensor is collocated with the actuator, the open-loop transfer function has alternating poles and zeros which facilitate to guarantee the stability of the closed loop system cite:preumont02_force_feedb_versus_accel_feedb.

However, when the platform is rotating, gyroscopic effects alter the system dynamics and IFF cannot be applied as is.
The purpose of this paper is to study how the IFF strategy can be adapted to deal with these Gyroscopic effects.

The paper is structured as follows.
Section ref:sec:dynamics presents a simple model of a rotating suspended platform that will be used throughout this study.
Section ref:sec:iff explains how the unconditional stability of IFF is lost due to Gyroscopic effects induced by the rotation.
Section ref:sec:iff_hpf suggests a simple modification of the control law such that damping can be added to the suspension modes in a robust way.
Section ref:sec:iff_kp proposes to add springs in parallel with the force sensors to regain the unconditional stability of IFF.
Section ref:sec:comparison compares both proposed modifications to the classical IFF in terms of damping authority and closed-loop system behavior.

* Dynamics of Rotating Platforms
<<sec:dynamics>>
** Model of a Rotating Platform                                      :ignore:
In order to study how the rotation does affect the use of IFF, a model of a suspended platform on top of a rotating stage is used.
Figure ref:fig:system represents the model schematically which is the simplest in which gyroscopic forces can be studied.

#+name: fig:system
#+caption: Schematic of the studied System
#+attr_latex: :scale 1
[[file:figs/system.pdf]]

The rotating stage is supposed to be ideal, meaning it induces a perfect rotation $\theta(t) = \Omega t$ where $\Omega$ is the rotational speed in $\si{\radian\per\second}$.

The suspended platform consists of two orthogonal actuators represented by three elements in parallel: a spring with a stiffness $k$ in $\si{\newton\per\meter}$, a dashpot with a damping coefficient $c$ in $\si{\newton\per\meter\second}$ and an ideal force source $F_u, F_v$.
A payload with a mass $m$ in $\si{\kilo\gram}$, representing the sensitive equipment, is mounted on the (rotating) suspended platform.

Two reference frames are used: an inertial frame $(\vec{i}_x, \vec{i}_y, \vec{i}_z)$ and a uniform rotating frame $(\vec{i}_u, \vec{i}_v, \vec{i}_w)$ rigidly fixed on top of the rotating stage with $\vec{i}_w$ aligned with the rotation axis.
The position of the payload is represented by $(d_u, d_v, 0)$ expressed in the rotating frame.

** Equations of Motion                                               :ignore:
To obtain the equations of motion for the system represented in Figure ref:fig:system, the Lagrangian equations are used:
#+name: eq:lagrangian_equations
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right) + \frac{\partial D}{\partial \dot{q}_i} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = Q_i
\end{equation}
with $L = T - V$ the Lagrangian, $T$ the kinetic coenergy, $V$ the potential energy, $D$ the dissipation function, and $Q_i$ the generalized force associated with the generalized variable $\begin{bmatrix}q_1 & q_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}d_u & d_v\end{bmatrix}$.
The equation of motion corresponding to the constant rotation in the $(\vec{i}_x, \vec{i}_y)$ is disregarded as the motion is considered to be imposed by the rotation stage.
#+name: eq:energy_functions_lagrange
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    T & = \frac{1}{2} m \left( \left( \dot{d}_u - \Omega d_v \right)^2 + \left( \dot{d}_v + \Omega d_u \right)^2 \right), \quad V = \frac{1}{2} k \left( {d_u}^2 + {d_v}^2 \right),\\
    D &= \frac{1}{2} c \left( \dot{d}_u{}^2 + \dot{d}_v{}^2 \right), \quad Q_1 = F_u, \quad Q_2 = F_v
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Substituting equations eqref:eq:energy_functions_lagrange into eqref:eq:lagrangian_equations for both generalized coordinates gives two coupled differential equations
#+name: eq:eom_coupled
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    m \ddot{d}_u + c \dot{d}_u + ( k - m \Omega^2 ) d_u &= F_u + 2 m \Omega \dot{d}_v \\
    m \ddot{d}_v + c \dot{d}_v + ( k \underbrace{-\,m \Omega^2}_{\text{Centrif.}} ) d_v &= F_v \underbrace{-\,2 m \Omega \dot{d}_u}_{\text{Coriolis}}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The uniform rotation of the system induces two Gyroscopic effects as shown in Eq. eqref:eq:eom_coupled:
- Centrifugal forces: that can been seen as added negative stiffness $- m \Omega^2$ along $\vec{i}_u$ and $\vec{i}_v$
- Coriolis Forces: that couples the motion in the two orthogonal directions

One can verify that without rotation ($\Omega = 0$) the system becomes equivalent as to two uncoupled one degree of freedom mass-spring-damper systems:
#+name: eq:oem_no_rotation
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    m \ddot{d}_u + c \dot{d}_u + k d_u &= F_u \\
    m \ddot{d}_v + c \dot{d}_v + k d_v &= F_v
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

** Transfer Functions in the Laplace domain                          :ignore:
To study the dynamics of the system, the differential equations of motions eqref:eq:eom_coupled are transformed in the Laplace domain and the $2 \times 2$ transfer function matrix $\bm{G}_d$ from $\begin{bmatrix}F_u & F_v\end{bmatrix}$ to $\begin{bmatrix}d_u & d_v\end{bmatrix}$ is obtained
\begin{align}
  \begin{bmatrix} d_u \\ d_v \end{bmatrix} &= \bm{G}_d \begin{bmatrix} F_u \\ F_v \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:Gd_mimo_tf} \\
  \bm{G}_{d} &=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{ms^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2}{\left( m s^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2 \right)^2 + \left( 2 m \Omega s \right)^2} & \frac{2 m \Omega s}{\left( m s^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2 \right)^2 + \left( 2 m \Omega s \right)^2} \\
    \frac{-2 m \Omega s}{\left( m s^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2 \right)^2 + \left( 2 m \Omega s \right)^2} & \frac{ms^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2}{\left( m s^2 + cs + k - m \Omega^2 \right)^2 + \left( 2 m \Omega s \right)^2}
  \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:Gd_m_k_c}
\end{align}

To simplify the analysis, the undamped natural frequency $\omega_0$ and the damping ratio $\xi$ are used
\begin{equation}
  \omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \text{ in } \si{\radian\per\second}, \quad \xi = \frac{c}{2 \sqrt{k m}}
\end{equation}

The transfer function matrix $\bm{G}_d$ becomes equal to
#+name: eq:Gd_w0_xi_k
\begin{equation}
\bm{G}_{d} =
  \frac{1}{k}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2}}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} & \frac{2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0}}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} \\
    \frac{- 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0}}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} & \frac{\frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2}}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

For all further numerical analysis in this study, we consider $\omega_0 = \SI{1}{\radian\per\second}$, $k = \SI{1}{\newton\per\meter}$ and $\xi = 0.025 = \SI{2.5}{\percent}$.
Even though no system with such parameters will be encountered in practice, conclusions can be drawn relative to these parameters such that they can be generalized to any other set of parameters.

** System Dynamics and Campbell Diagram                              :ignore:
The poles of $\bm{G}_d$ are the complex solutions $p$ of
\begin{equation}
  \left( \frac{p^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{p}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{p}{\omega_0} \right)^2 = 0
\end{equation}

Supposing small damping ($\xi \ll 1$), two pairs of complex conjugate poles are obtained:
#+name: eq:pole_values
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    p_{+} &= - \xi \omega_0 \left( 1 + \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \right) \pm j \omega_0 \left( 1 + \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \right) \\
    p_{-} &= - \xi \omega_0 \left( 1 - \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \right) \pm j \omega_0 \left( 1 - \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \right)
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The real part and complex part of these two pairs of complex conjugate poles are represented in Figure ref:fig:campbell_diagram as a function of the rotational speed $\Omega$.
As the rotational speed increases, $p_{+}$ goes to higher frequencies and $p_{-}$ to lower frequencies.
The system becomes unstable for $\Omega > \omega_0$ as the real part of $p_{-}$ is positive.
Physically, the negative stiffness term $-m\Omega^2$ induced by centrifugal forces exceeds the spring stiffness $k$.

In the rest of this study, rotational speeds smaller than the undamped natural frequency of the system are assumed ($\Omega < \omega_0$).

Looking at the transfer function matrix $\bm{G}_d$ in Eq. eqref:eq:Gd_w0_xi_k, one can see that the two diagonal (direct) terms are equal and the two off-diagonal (coupling) terms are opposite.
The bode plot of these two distinct terms are shown in Figure ref:fig:plant_compare_rotating_speed for several rotational speeds $\Omega$.
These plots confirm the expected behavior: the frequency of the two pairs of complex conjugate poles are further separated as $\Omega$ increases.
For $\Omega > \omega_0$, the low frequency pair of complex conjugate poles $p_{-}$ becomes unstable.

* Decentralized Integral Force Feedback
<<sec:iff>>
** Force Sensors and Control Architecture                            :ignore:
In order to apply IFF to the system, force sensors are added in series with the two actuators (Figure ref:fig:system_iff).
As this study focuses on decentralized control, two identical controllers $K_F$ are used to feedback each of the sensed force to its associated actuator and no attempt is made to counteract the interactions in the system.
The control diagram is schematically shown in Figure ref:fig:control_diagram_iff.

** Plant Dynamics                                                    :ignore:
The forces $\begin{bmatrix}f_u & f_v\end{bmatrix}$ measured by the two force sensors represented in Figure ref:fig:system_iff are equal to
#+name: eq:measured_force
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix} f_{u} \\ f_{v} \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} F_u \\ F_v \end{bmatrix} - (c s + k)
  \begin{bmatrix} d_u \\ d_v \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Inserting eqref:eq:Gd_w0_xi_k into eqref:eq:measured_force yields
\begin{align}
  \begin{bmatrix} f_{u} \\ f_{v} \end{bmatrix} &= \bm{G}_{f} \begin{bmatrix} F_u \\ F_v \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:Gf_mimo_tf} \\
  \bm{G}_{f} &= \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} - \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right) \left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right) + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} & \frac{- \left( 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 \right) \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} \\
  \frac{\left( 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 \right) \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} & \frac{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} - \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right) \left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right) + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}
\end{bmatrix} \label{eq:Gf}
\end{align}

The zeros of the diagonal terms of $\bm{G}_f$ are equal to (neglecting the damping for simplicity)
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    z_c &= \pm j \omega_0 \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{8 \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 1} + \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + \frac{1}{2} } \label{eq:iff_zero_cc} \\
    z_r &= \pm   \omega_0 \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{8 \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 1} - \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} - \frac{1}{2} } \label{eq:iff_zero_real}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The frequency of the pair of complex conjugate zeros $z_c$ eqref:eq:iff_zero_cc always lies between the frequency of the two pairs of complex conjugate poles $p_{-}$ and $p_{+}$ eqref:eq:pole_values.

For non-null rotational speeds, two real zeros $z_r$ eqref:eq:iff_zero_real appear in the diagonal terms inducing a non-minimum phase behavior.
This can be seen in the Bode plot of the diagonal terms (Figure ref:fig:plant_iff_compare_rotating_speed) where the low frequency gain is no longer zero while the phase stays at $\SI{180}{\degree}$.

The low frequency gain of $\bm{G}_f$ increases with the rotational speed $\Omega$
#+name: eq:low_freq_gain_iff_plan
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\omega \to 0} \left| \bm{G}_f (j\omega) \right| = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2 - \Omega^2} & 0 \\
  0  & \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2 - \Omega^2}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

This can be explained as follows: a constant force $F_u$ induces a small displacement of the mass $d_u = \frac{F_u}{k - m\Omega^2}$, which increases the centrifugal force $m\Omega^2d_u = \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2 - \Omega^2} F_u$ which is then measured by the force sensors.

** Decentralized Integral Force Feedback with Pure Integrators       :ignore:
<<sec:iff_pure_int>>
The two IFF controllers $K_F$ consist of a pure integrator
#+name: eq:Kf_pure_int
\begin{equation}
  \bm{K}_F(s) = \begin{bmatrix} K_F(s) & 0 \\ 0 & K_F(s) \end{bmatrix}, \quad K_F(s) = g \cdot \frac{1}{s}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is a scalar representing the gain of the controller.

In order to see how the IFF affects the poles of the closed loop system, a Root Locus plot (Figure ref:fig:root_locus_pure_iff) is constructed as follows: the poles of the closed-loop system are drawn in the complex plane as the controller gain $g$ varies from $0$ to $\infty$ for the two controllers simultaneously.
As explained in cite:preumont08_trans_zeros_struc_contr_with,skogestad07_multiv_feedb_contr, the closed-loop poles start at the open-loop poles (shown by $\tikz[baseline=-0.6ex] \node[cross out, draw=black, minimum size=1ex, line width=2pt, inner sep=0pt, outer sep=0pt] at (0, 0){};$) for $g = 0$ and coincide with the transmission zeros (shown by $\tikz[baseline=-0.6ex] \draw[line width=2pt, inner sep=0pt, outer sep=0pt] (0,0) circle[radius=3pt];$) as $g \to \infty$.
The direction of increasing gain is indicated by arrows $\tikz[baseline=-0.6ex] \draw[-{Stealth[round]},line width=2pt] (0,0) -- (0.3,0);$.

#+name: fig:root_locus_pure_iff
#+caption: Root Locus: evolution of the closed-loop poles with increasing controller gains $g$
#+attr_latex: :scale 1
[[file:figs/root_locus_pure_iff.pdf]]

Whereas collocated IFF is usually associated with unconditional stability cite:preumont91_activ, this property is lost as soon as the rotational speed in non-null due to gyroscopic effects.
This can be seen in the Root Locus plot (Figure ref:fig:root_locus_pure_iff) where the poles corresponding to the controller are bound to the right half plane implying closed-loop system instability.

Physically, this can be explain like so: at low frequency, the loop gain is very large due to the pure integrators in $K_F$.
The control system is thus canceling the spring forces which makes the suspended platform no able to hold the payload against centrifugal forces, hence the instability.

In order to apply Decentralized IFF on rotating positioning stages, two solutions are proposed to deal with this instability problem.
The first one consists of slightly modifying the control law (Section ref:sec:iff_hpf) while the second one consists of adding springs in parallel with the force sensors (Section ref:sec:iff_kp).

* Integral Force Feedback with High Pass Filter
<<sec:iff_hpf>>
** Modification of the Control Low                                   :ignore:
As was explained in the previous section, the instability when using IFF with pure integrators comes from high controller gain at low frequency.

In order to limit the low frequency controller gain, an high pass filter (HPF) can be added to the controller
#+name: eq:IFF_LHF
\begin{equation}
  \bm{K}_F(s) = \begin{bmatrix} K_F(s) & 0 \\ 0 & K_F(s) \end{bmatrix}, \quad K_{F}(s) = g \cdot \frac{1}{s} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{s/\omega_i}{1 + s/\omega_i}}_{\text{HPF}} = g \cdot \frac{1}{s + \omega_i}
\end{equation}

This is equivalent to slightly shifting the controller pole to the left along the real axis.

This modification of the IFF controller is typically done to avoid saturation associated with the pure integrator cite:preumont91_activ.
This is however not the case in this study as it will become clear in the next section.

** Feedback Analysis                                                 :ignore:
The loop gains for the decentralized controllers $K_F(s)$ with and without the added HPF are shown in Figure ref:fig:loop_gain_modified_iff.
The effect of the added HPF limits the low frequency gain as expected.

The Root Loci for the decentralized IFF with and without the HPF are displayed in Figure ref:fig:root_locus_modified_iff.
With the added HPF, the poles of the closed loop system are shown to be stable up to some value of the gain $g_\text{max}$
#+name: eq:gmax_iff_hpf
\begin{equation}
  g_{\text{max}} = \omega_i \left( \frac{{\omega_0}^2}{\Omega^2} - 1 \right)
\end{equation}
It is interesting to note that $g_{\text{max}}$ also corresponds to the gain where the low frequency loop gain (Figure ref:fig:loop_gain_modified_iff) reaches one.

** Optimal Control Parameters                                        :ignore:
Two parameters can be tuned for the controller eqref:eq:IFF_LHF: the gain $g$ and the pole's location $\omega_i$.
The optimal values of $\omega_i$ and $g$ are here considered as the values for which the damping of all the closed-loop poles are simultaneously maximized.

In order to visualize how $\omega_i$ does affect the attainable damping, the Root Loci for several $\omega_i$ are displayed in Figure ref:fig:root_locus_wi_modified_iff.
It is shown that even though small $\omega_i$ seem to allow more damping to be added to the system resonances, the control gain $g$ may be limited to small values due to Eq. eqref:eq:gmax_iff_hpf.

In order to study this trade off, the attainable closed-loop damping ratio $\xi_{\text{cl}}$ is computed as a function of the ratio $\omega_i/\omega_0$.
The gain $g_{\text{opt}}$ at which this maximum damping is obtained is also display and compared with the gain $g_{\text{max}}$ at which the system becomes unstable (Figure ref:fig:mod_iff_damping_wi).

Three regions can be observed:
- $\frac{\omega_i}{\omega_0} < 0.02$: the added damping is limited by the maximum allowed control gain $g_{\text{max}}$
- $0.02 < \frac{\omega_i}{\omega_0} < 0.2$: good amount of damping can be added for $g \approx 2$
- $0.2 < \frac{\omega_i}{\omega_0}$: the added damping becomes small due to the shape of the Root Locus (Figure ref:fig:root_locus_wi_modified_iff)

* Integral Force Feedback with Parallel Springs
<<sec:iff_kp>>
** Stiffness in Parallel with the Force Sensor                       :ignore:
As was explained in section ref:sec:iff_pure_int, the instability when using decentralized IFF for rotating positioning platforms is due to Gyroscopic effects and, more precisely, due to the negative stiffness induced by centrifugal forces.
In this section additional springs in parallel with the force sensors are added to counteract this negative stiffness.
Such springs are schematically shown in Figure ref:fig:system_parallel_springs where $k_a$ is the stiffness of the actuator and $k_p$ the stiffness in parallel with the actuator and force sensor.

Amplified piezoelectric stack actuators can also be used for such purpose where a part of the piezoelectric stack is used as an actuator while the rest is used as a force sensor cite:souleille18_concep_activ_mount_space_applic.
The parallel stiffness $k_p$ then corresponds to the amplification structure.
An example of such system is shown in Figure ref:fig:cedrat_xy25xs.

** Effect of the Parallel Stiffness on the Plant Dynamics            :ignore:
The forces $\begin{bmatrix}f_u, f_v\end{bmatrix}$ measured by the two force sensors represented in Figure ref:fig:system_parallel_springs are equal to
#+name: eq:measured_force_kp
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix} f_{u} \\ f_{v} \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} F_u \\ F_v \end{bmatrix} - (c s + k_a)
  \begin{bmatrix} d_u \\ d_v \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

In order to keep the overall stiffness $k = k_a + k_p$ constant, a scalar parameter $\alpha$ ($0 \le \alpha < 1$) is defined to describe the fraction of the total stiffness in parallel with the actuator and force sensor
\begin{equation}
  k_p = \alpha k, \quad k_a = (1 - \alpha) k
\end{equation}

The equations of motion are derived and transformed in the Laplace domain

  \frac{\left( 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \alpha \right) \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2} & \frac{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} - \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + \alpha \right) \left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right) + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}{\left( \frac{s^2}{{\omega_0}^2} + 2 \xi \frac{s}{\omega_0} + 1 - \frac{{\Omega}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Omega}{\omega_0} \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)^2}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Comparing $\bm{G}_k$ eqref:eq:Gk with $\bm{G}_f$ eqref:eq:Gf shows that while the poles of the system are kept the same, the zeros of the diagonal terms have changed.
The two real zeros $z_r$ eqref:eq:iff_zero_real that were inducing non-minimum phase behavior are transformed into complex conjugate zeros if the following condition hold
#+name: eq:kp_cond_cc_zeros
\begin{equation}
  \alpha > \frac{\Omega^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad k_p > m \Omega^2
\end{equation}

Thus, if the added parallel stiffness $k_p$ is higher than the negative stiffness induced by centrifugal forces $m \Omega^2$, the direct dynamics from actuator to force sensor will show minimum phase behavior.
This is confirmed by the Bode plot in Figure ref:fig:plant_iff_kp.

Figure ref:fig:root_locus_iff_kp shows Root Loci plots for $k_p = 0$, $k_p < m \Omega^2$ and $k_p > m \Omega^2$ when $K_F$ is a pure integrator eqref:eq:Kf_pure_int.
It is shown that if the added stiffness is higher than the maximum negative stiffness, the poles of the closed-loop system stay in the (stable) right half-plane, and hence the unconditional stability of IFF is recovered.

** Optimal Parallel Stiffness                                        :ignore:
Even though the parallel stiffness $k_p$ has no impact on the open-loop poles (as the overall stiffness $k$ stays constant), it has a large impact on the transmission zeros.
Moreover, as the attainable damping is generally proportional to the distance between poles and zeros cite:preumont18_vibrat_contr_activ_struc_fourt_edition, the parallel stiffness $k_p$ is foreseen to have a large impact on the attainable damping.

To study this effect, Root Locus plots for several parallel stiffnesses $k_p > m \Omega^2$ are shown in Figure ref:fig:root_locus_iff_kps.
The frequencies of the transmission zeros of the system are increasing with the parallel stiffness $k_p$ and the associated attainable damping is reduced.
Therefore, even though the parallel stiffness $k_p$ should be larger than $m \Omega^2$ for stability reasons, it should not be taken too high as this would limit the attainable bandwidth.

For any $k_p > m \Omega^2$, the control gain $g$ can be tuned such that the maximum simultaneous damping $\xi_\text{opt}$ is added to the resonances of the system.
# An example is shown in Figure ref:fig:root_locus_opt_gain_iff_kp for $k_p = 5 m \Omega^2$ where the damping $\xi_{\text{opt}} \approx 0.83$ is obtained for a control gain $g_\text{opt} \approx 2 \omega_0$.

* Comparison and Discussion
<<sec:comparison>>
** Introduction                                                      :ignore:
Two modifications to the decentralized IFF for rotating positioning stages have been proposed.

The first modification concerns the controller and consists of adding an high pass filter to $K_F$ eqref:eq:IFF_LHF.
The system was shown to be stable for gains up to $g_\text{max}$ eqref:eq:gmax_iff_hpf.

The second proposed modification concerns the mechanical system.
It was shown that if springs with a stiffness $k_p > m \Omega^2$ are added in parallel to the actuators and force sensors, decentralized IFF can be applied with unconditional stability.

These two methods are now compared in terms of added damping, closed-loop compliance and transmissibility.
For the following comparisons, the cut-off frequency for the high pass filters is set to $\omega_i = 0.1 \omega_0$ and the parallel springs have a stiffness $k_p = 5 m \Omega^2$.

** Comparison of the Attainable Damping                              :ignore:
Figure ref:fig:comp_root_locus shows two Root Locus plots for the two proposed IFF techniques.
While the two pairs of complex conjugate open-loop poles are identical for both techniques, the transmission zeros are not.
This means that their closed-loop behavior will differ when large control gains are used.

It is interesting to note that the maximum added damping is very similar for both techniques and is reached for the same control gain in both cases $g_\text{opt} \approx 2 \omega_0$.

** Comparison Transmissibility and Compliance                        :ignore:
The two proposed techniques are now compared in terms of closed-loop compliance and transmissibility.

The compliance is defined as the transfer function from external forces applied to the payload to the displacement of the payload in an inertial frame.
The transmissibility describes the dynamic behavior between the displacement of the rotating stage and the displacement of the payload.
It is used to characterize how much vibration of the rotating stage is transmitted to the payload.

The two techniques are also compared with passive damping (Figure ref:fig:system) where $c = c_\text{crit}$ is tuned to critically damp the resonance when the rotating speed is null.

\begin{equation}
  c_\text{crit} = 2 \sqrt{k m}
\end{equation}

Very similar results are obtained for the two proposed decentralized IFF modifications in terms of compliance (Figure ref:fig:comp_compliance) and transmissibility (Figure ref:fig:comp_transmissibility).
It is also confirmed that these two techniques can significantly damp the system's resonances.

# TODO - Rework. It degrades the compliance as usual with IFF. (it is even better than classical IFF)
Compared to passive damping, the two techniques degrade the compliance at low frequency (Figure ref:fig:comp_compliance).
They however do not degrade the transmissibility at high frequency as it is the case with passive damping (Figure ref:fig:comp_transmissibility).
